# Introduction to Data Science in Python

**I Confess**
----
In *assignment 3*, it took me more than 5 hours to solve the first 10 questions. I lost patience and skipped Questions 11 and 12. But I scored 77 and still needed to 3 more score. So I just copied a solution for the Question 13 from the web.

Please spare me!
