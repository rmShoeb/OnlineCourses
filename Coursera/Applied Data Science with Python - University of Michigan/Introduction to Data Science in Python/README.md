**My opinion**

Assignment 3 and 4 got me disgusted. The questions are hard to interpret. Spent more than half the time just to figure out what the heck they want me to find! Had to search through the forum everytime to find out the meaning of the questions. Even one *Teaching Staff* admitted that the questions are not explanatory enough.

I would understand if the questions were hard. But no, the questions are not hard, these are absolute PAIN!

So, unless you have a lot of patience (unlike me), you can try this course. I did not finish this course.
