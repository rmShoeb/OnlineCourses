I did not solve the second problem in week-3. I just copied the code from [TheGeekiestOne](https://github.com/TheGeekiestOne/Coursera-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Specialization/blob/master/Course%202%20-%20Data%20Structures/week2_priority_queues_and_disjoint_sets/2_job_queue/job_queue.cpp). But I truely solved rest of the problems myself (those that I have uploaded here).
